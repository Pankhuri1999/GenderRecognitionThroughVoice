# GenderRecognitionThroughVoice
This project is an independent attempt to research about human voices in terms of gender, age and emotion. Presently, I am in the first phase of this project, where I am trying to collect different dataset for the same. I am looking over tutorial on Internet to see different ways of implementing this project and how much work has been done on it.

As of now, I am using these two links as my tutorials for this project.
